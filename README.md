# Dice-Roller
GUI of a D&D-like Dice Roller.  
Avaiable Dices: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, D100  
 All dices accept modifiers. If a dice is rolled more than once the modifier is applied after all the rolls.   
 If the modifier make the result a negative number a 1 is displayed instead (1 being the lowest score possible of a real dice)   
 The number of rolls is selectable with the arrow of a spinbox (up to 100 rolls)  
 or by typing the number of rolls desidered (no limit to number of rolls)  
 Rolls of different dices are not summed. The result is the sum of the rolls of a single type of dice.
